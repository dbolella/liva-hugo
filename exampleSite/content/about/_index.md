---
Danny Bolella is a Software Developer Lead (iOS) at a major trading company. He's a Stevens Tech alumni (’12) with over a decade of developer experience under his belt. With a number of projects completed for a handful of companies, Danny has done everything from full-stack web to mobile development (iOS being his true passion). One of his favorite projects was working on an app that connected to first-to-market, BLE-enabled prescription inhalers, improving the lives of many patients and enabling research with data like never before.

Danny is married to his wonderful wife, Alyssa, and father to a son with another son on the way this August! He really enjoys coding for fun, reading biographies/memoirs, listening to music, and writing tech articles (\[Danny Bolella – Medium\]([https://dbolella.medium.com/](https://dbolella.medium.com/ "https://dbolella.medium.com/"))).
